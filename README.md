# Keras without model.fit

## Introduction

Keras is easy to used in most situations. However, in some complex situation, 
like training Generative Adversarial Networks or training multiple models 
at same time, **model.compile** and **model.fit** are not flexible to used.

In this example, showing how training a classification network with MNIST dataset 
by using Keras backend functions only.
